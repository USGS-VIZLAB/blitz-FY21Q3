# idea blitz FY21Q3

This repository is intended to store projects from the Vizlab idea blitz FY2021 Q3. 

Place each new plot/idea/gif in its own subdirectory. Use a descriptive folder name to help us find it again later.

- Use relative paths that assume the working directory == the subdirectory. (This will help with later renaming if needed.)
- If you create a remake.yaml, place it within the subdirectory.
- If you want to reuse code from other scratch subdirectories, place a copy of the code in your current subdirectory.

Commit the final figures to this repository. This should help others to discover figures and code to reuse.
- Try to minimize the number of times you commit and re-commit each figure to save space...but only make a reasonable, not extreme, effort.
